# EduVM - An educational virtual machine

### Why a VM?

Virtual Machines are everywhere nowadays and I've always wondered how they work. I also wanted to learn C so I thought the best way to learn about both was to make my own simple VM in C :)

I hope that this project can be used to educate others on not just how virtual machines work, but also computers. It's also a good project to demonstrate the C language.

I recommend reading the ByteCodeExplanation file to rid any confusion of some of the logic in the vm_instruct_exec function.
